			<h2 class="accent">Conclusion</h2>
			<p class="white"> With the rise of ecommerce, it’s only natural that the number of online shoppers worldwide rises along with it. As it stands in 2021, the number of digital buyers is at 2.14 billion. That makes 27.6 percent of the 7.74 billion people in the world. In other words, more than one out of every four people you see around you is an online shopper.</p>
				<p class="white"> The number of online shoppers has been growing over the past few years. In 2021, there were 900 million more digital buyers than there were in 2020—a 4.4 percent year-over-year increase. </p>
			  <p class="white">Online shopping is growing so fast that the global online shopping market size nearly hit 4 trillion in 2020. And in the US alone, we’re expecting to have 300 million online shoppers in 2023.That’s 91% of the country’s current population!</p>

<p class="white">So far, 69% of Americans have shopped online, and 25% of Americans shop online at least once per month. The majority (59%) of these shoppers bought clothing items, and 47% bought their first item on Amazon.</p>

<p class="white">But Americans aren’t the only ones who shop online. People all over the world understand the benefits. According to Invesp, the countries with the leading average eCommerce revenue per shoppers are: USA ($1,804), UK ($1,629), Sweden ($1,446), France ($1,228), Germany ($1,064), Japan ($968), Spain ($849), China ($626), Russia ($396), and Brazil ($350).</p>
