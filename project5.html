				<h2 class="white" style="margin-top: 1%;margin-bottom: 1%;">Concerts and Moshpits</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 1%;margin-bottom: 1%;">
				Heavy metal concerts also usually involve ‘moshing’ and ‘stage-diving’. Moshing is a sort
of group dance (often in a circle) that takes place in front of the stage, an area that is also
known as the ‘mosh pit’. Moshing is sometimes referred to as ‘slamming’, although there
is a subtle difference between them, in that the latter involves particularly forceful body
movements. </p><p>Moshing is mostly a masculine activity which
may seem to be more aggressive and less inviting to women, who might find themselves
attacked by newcomers who do not understand the respectful attitude that is inherent 
in a successful pit. In stage-diving members of the audience
climb up to the stage, touch or imitate the band members for a moment, and dive back
into the audience into the arms of ‘catchers

				<h2 class="white" style="margin-top: 1%;margin-bottom: 1%;">Airsoft</h2>
				<p class="white"> Airsoft is a competitive team shooting game in which participants eliminate opposing players by tagging them out of play with spherical plastic projectiles launched via replica air weapons called airsoft guns.</p>
				<p class="white">Although very similar to paintball in concept and gameplay, airsoft pellets do not typically leave visible markings on their target and hits are not always apparent. Though the pellets can sometimes leave red contusions or "welts" on exposed skin, the game relies heavily on an honor system in which the player who has been hit is ethically obliged to call themselves out.</p>

				<h2 class="white" style="margin-top: 1%;margin-bottom: 1%;">Origin and background</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 1%;margin-bottom: 1%;">
				Airsoft originated from Japan in the early 1970s, when photographer Ichiro Nagata, thought about making model guns that shoot real projectiles that could not kill. These “guns” were trademarked as "soft air gun".</p><p> The name "soft air" referred to the compressed Freon-silicone oil mixture later replaced by a propane-silicone oil mixture that was used as a propellant gas, which was significantly weaker than the cannistered CO2 used in proper airguns. Originally designed for target shooting, the plastic balls these "soft air guns" use can be shot at humans without causing injury. After Tokyo Marui introduced its revolutionary electric motor-gear box design, which allows sustainable rapid-fire using rechargeable batteries, soft air guns became popular for casual wargames.

				<p class="white"> A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device to generate visual feedback. This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. </p><p class="white">Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology</p>

				<h2 class="white" style="margin-top: 1%;margin-bottom: 1%;">Bloodborne</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 1%;margin-bottom: 1%;">
				Bloodborne is my favourite video game and it's an A-RPG developed by FromSoftware which released in March 2015. Bloodborne follows the player's character, a Hunter, through the decrepit Gothic, Victorian era–inspired city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants are afflicted with a blood-borne disease. Attempting to find the source of the plague, the player's character unravels the city's mysteries while fighting beasts and cosmic beings.</p><p class>Bloodborne received critical acclaim, with praise being directed at its gameplay, particularly its high level of difficulty, sound design, Lovecraftian themes, and interconnected world design. An expansion adding additional content, The Old Hunters, was released in November 2015. By the end of 2015, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide.
